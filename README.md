## Programming the MicroBit

### Environment And Languages

Micro:bit can be programmed using Blocks, JavaScript, and Python. No environment setup required to write code for micro:bit, instead you need just a web browser to access the online editor, write your code and download it to micro:bit.

### Blocks and JavaScript
1. To write code using Blocks or JavaScript go to the online [MakeCode editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/)
2. Choose the desired language Blocks or JavaScript from the switch in the middle of the top bar.
3. Write your code. If you are using blocks then you can drag and drop the required piece of code from the left side bar.
4. A simulator is found in the editor on the left side that helps you test your code before writing it to the chip.
4. Click download to get a .hex file that can be used to program the micro:bit.
5. You can also choose to save the project in the editor. This will save the project in the browser you are using and will only be accessible from the same browser, using different browser or different computer you will not be able to access the projects.

### Python
1. To write code using Python go to the [online editor](https://python.microbit.org/v/1.1)
2. Write your code
3. Click download to get a .hex file that can be used to program the micro:bit
4. You can click on save to get python file (.py) of the source code
5. If you already have a .hex file or .py file you can load it by clicking on load button then choosing the file. Note: if you chose to load .hex file make sure you exported it using python editor not MakeCode Editor

### Programming the Chip
After writing the code and extracting .hex file using the online editor then it is time to program the chip.
1. Connect micro:bit using the micro USB cable.
2. micro:bit will show in your computer as a drive.
3. Copy the .hex file to micro:bit drive.
4. You can now disconnect micro:bit and start using the program.
5. You can click the reset button on the back of micro:bit to start the program from the beginning.
